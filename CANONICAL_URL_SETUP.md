# ✅ URL Canonicalization - Ready to Deploy

## Problem Solved
Your website now redirects **ALL variations** to a single canonical URL:

```
❌ http://www.travelwiki.org.in      →  ✅ https://travelwiki.org.in
❌ http://travelwiki.org.in          →  ✅ https://travelwiki.org.in
❌ https://www.travelwiki.org.in     →  ✅ https://travelwiki.org.in
✅ https://travelwiki.org.in         →  ✅ Already correct!
```

## Files Created (All in `dist` folder)

| File | Purpose | Works On |
|------|---------|----------|
| `_redirects` | Netlify/Vercel redirects | Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages |
| `_headers` | Security headers | Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages |
| `.htaccess` | Apache redirects & security | Apache servers, cPanel hosting |
| `web.config` | IIS redirects & security | Windows/IIS servers |

**All files are built and ready in your `dist` folder!** ✅

## Quick Deployment Guide

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended - Easiest) 🚀

1. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   ```bash
   # Option A: Drag & drop
   # Just drag the 'dist' folder to Netlify's web interface
   
   # Option B: Netlify CLI
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
   ```

2. **That's it!** Netlify automatically:
   - ✅ Reads `_redirects` file
   - ✅ Applies all redirect rules
   - ✅ Adds security headers from `_headers`
   - ✅ No configuration needed!

3. **Verify it works**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://www.travelwiki.org.in
   # Should show: 301 → https://travelwiki.org.in
   ```

---

### Option 2: Vercel 🚀

1. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   # Option A: Vercel CLI
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel --prod
   
   # Option B: Connect GitHub repo
   # Push to GitHub → Connect to Vercel → Auto-deploy
   ```

2. **That's it!** Vercel automatically:
   - ✅ Reads `_redirects` file
   - ✅ Applies redirect rules
   - ✅ No configuration needed!

---

### Option 3: Apache/cPanel Shared Hosting 🌐

1. **Build your project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload via FTP or cPanel File Manager**:
   - Upload entire `dist` folder contents to `public_html`
   - Ensure `.htaccess` is uploaded (enable "Show Hidden Files")

3. **Verify .htaccess is working**:
   ```bash
   curl -I http://www.travelwiki.org.in
   # Should redirect to https://travelwiki.org.in
   ```

4. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If not working, check Apache has `mod_rewrite` enabled
   - Check `.htaccess` permissions: `chmod 644 .htaccess`
   - Contact hosting support to enable mod_rewrite if needed

---

### Option 4: Windows/IIS Server 🪟

1. **Install URL Rewrite Module**:
   - Download: https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite

2. **Deploy `dist` folder** to IIS website root

3. **`web.config` is automatically loaded** by IIS

4. **Verify in IIS Manager**:
   - Open IIS Manager
   - Select your site → URL Rewrite
   - You should see all redirect rules

## Testing After Deployment

### Test 1: www → non-www
```bash
curl -I https://www.travelwiki.org.in
```
**Expected**: `301` redirect to `https://travelwiki.org.in`

### Test 2: HTTP → HTTPS
```bash
curl -I http://travelwiki.org.in
```
**Expected**: `301` redirect to `https://travelwiki.org.in`

### Test 3: Trailing slash removal
```bash
curl -I https://travelwiki.org.in/about/
```
**Expected**: `301` redirect to `https://travelwiki.org.in/about`

### Test 4: Online Tools
Use these to verify:
- https://www.redirect-checker.org/
- https://httpstatus.io/

Enter both:
- `https://travelwiki.org.in`
- `https://www.travelwiki.org.in`

Both should resolve to `https://travelwiki.org.in` ✅
