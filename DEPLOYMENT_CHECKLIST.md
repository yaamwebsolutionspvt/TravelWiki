## Deployment

### For Netlify (Recommended)
The `_redirects` and `_headers` files work automatically!

1. Deploy the `dist` folder to Netlify
2. Netlify will automatically read:
   - `_redirects` for URL redirects
   - `_headers` for security headers

### For Vercel
You may need to add configuration to `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "https://www.travelwiki.org.in/:path*",
      "destination": "https://travelwiki.org.in/:path*",
      "permanent": true
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Strict-Transport-Security",
          "value": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Frame-Options",
          "value": "DENY"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-XSS-Protection",
          "value": "1; mode=block"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### For Other Hosting Providers
Configure these in your server settings:
- URL redirects (www to non-www)
- HTTPS enforcement
- Security headers (HSTS, etc.)
