## ✅ All Issues Fixed

### HIGH Priority Issues (Fixed 3/3)

#### 1. ✅ URL Canonicalization Issues - FIXED

  - Force HTTPS for all traffic
  - Remove trailing slashes from URLs
  - SPA fallback for 404 handling
- Added canonical URL in base HTML (`index.html`)

#### 2. ✅ Eliminate Render-Blocking Resources - FIXED

**Solution Implemented**:
- Fonts now use `preload` with `onload` handler for async loading
- Added `font-display: swap` to prevent render blocking
- Added DNS prefetch hints for Google Fonts
- Optimized resource loading order
- Critical CSS already inlined in HTML
- All JavaScript uses `type="module"` for automatic deferring

**Solution Implemented**:

---

#### 5. ✅ Avoid Distorted Images - FIXED
**Problem**: Images may appear stretched or distorted
**Solution Implemented**:
- All images now use CSS `aspect-ratio` property
- Added `objectFit` prop (default: 'cover') to prevent distortion
- Enforces width and height attributes for proper aspect ratio
- `maxWidth: 100%` and `height: auto` for responsive scaling
- Prevents Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/OptimizedImage.jsx`
