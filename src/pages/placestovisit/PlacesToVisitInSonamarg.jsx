                  The Gold Meadows are the specific meadows that give Sonamarg its name, where the interplay 
                  of sunlight and grass creates the golden appearance that inspired the "Meadow of Gold" 
                  designation. These expansive grasslands, particularly beautiful during late afternoon and 
                  early morning, offer visitors the quintessential Sonamarg experience. The meadows serve as 
                  natural viewpoints for the surrounding mountain ranges and provide perfect locations for 
                  camping, picnicking, and nature photography.
